# OCRLogger
Web image scraper, for logging numbers using Tesseract OCR and Firebase hosting.

Software is for a local client which schedules downloads of an image and runs OCR on specified regions to get numbers and text.
The data is written to a local CSV file and optionally hosted with Firebase.

The public API can trigger creation of a time series plot created with JFreeChart.
